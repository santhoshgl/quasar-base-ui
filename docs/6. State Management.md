# State Management

Two different libraries

1. VueX
2. Pinia

## VueX

- VueX is currently in maintenance mode now
- Vue Core team has suggested moving away from VueX because of the new features in composition API and Pinia taking advatage of it

## Pinia

- Centralised Store
- Sharing state across pages and components easily

### Why Pinia

- DevTools support
  - Track every action
  - Time Travel for debugging
- HMR
  - Modify store without reloading
  - Keep any existing state while developing
- Plugin System
- TS support
- SSR support

### Introduction

- Stores are setup using [`defineStore`](https://pinia.vuejs.org/core-concepts/)
- Access the store using the composable [`useStore`](https://pinia.vuejs.org/core-concepts/#using-the-store)
- Destructuring state values from store lose reactivity
- Mutations are not required any change to state is recorded as mutations

### [State](https://pinia.vuejs.org/core-concepts/state.html)

- Create state in a different file
- Can mutate state directly
- Can use `$patch` to update state to update states partially or get access to previous state
- Can replace entire state using `$state`

### [Getters](https://pinia.vuejs.org/core-concepts/getters.html)

- Getters need to be part of `defineStore` to obtain `this` which is context to access the current pinia store

### [Actions](https://pinia.vuejs.org/core-concepts/actions.html)

- Actions need to be part of `defineStore` to obtain `this` which is context to access the current pinia store

### Setup

- Auth store is defined already
- State is present to track signed in status
- Add stores as per requirement

### Creating a store

- Create folder with store <name>
- Create `index.js` with `createStore('<name>')`
- Create separate `state.js` file
